<!--
Appropriate use of built-in canvas context methods. No external canvas libraries are permitted: instead, use JavaScript and generate your own solutions from the built-in foundation. (2 points)

Generated shapes. Using our examples for creating functions to draw shapes, design at least five functions for different shapes that will be generated as part of your animation. These should include unusual non-regular shapes (not just circles and squares, although that can be two of your five.) (5 points)

Use of text. Your animation should use text as part of the design. This might include generating messages that display in unexpected ways, integrating a title sequence, or using letters and words as part of the animation itself.  (3 points)

Smooth progressive movement. At each stage, the animation should recalculate the movement of objects based on their previous location. Objects may disappear and can be generated at random, but there must be some continuity between frames. (3 points)

Thoughtful color and design. The animation should build patterns or complexity at intervals while demonstrating intention of design in all elements, including use of color and contrast. (2 points)
